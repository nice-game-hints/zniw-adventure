You've met Sam the Snake, and had a sssuper conversation with him.

If you forgot his answers:
"And who might you be?" ^[Sam the friendly snake, accidentally thrown into the river by the Euoplocephalus.]
"Any idea about that Euoplocephalus?" ^[You could try to pull him out from the other side.]
"Why didn't you just swim through the river?" ^[He got tired, and might even drown if he tries again - some food would really help.]

Basically, you need to find a snack for him to regain his strength.

# How about fruit? Herbs?
There was plenty of red fruit growing to the south, but Zniw is too greedy to share fruit.

# How about flowers?
If you picked the white flowers that were growing near the fruit, they're actually used to get one of the hidden pebbles.

If you want to know exactly how to get the hidden pebble - ^[Feed the flowers to the Euoplocephalus to get it as a reward.]

# What do Snakes eat, anyway?
Meat.

# Where do I find meat?
Have you fully explored this riverbed?

# I think so?
And you still haven't found any meat?

# Nope.
Travel far to the right - past the Hesperonychus - to find a new area.

# How do I get the meat?
You need a long item to get it away from the crocodile's mouth without risking your arms.

# What do you suggest?
Something long that could skewer the meat.

## Where do I find something like that?
You'll find a stick in the same place you found the first log - south of the submerged crocodile, near the fruit.

## What do I do with this stick?
It's exactly what you need to get the meat off the big crocodile's tooth! Go use the stick on the meat!

# And what do I do with the meat?
It's the exact type of snack that Sam wanted - go give it to him!

Crossing the river won't be easy with those menacing eyes watching you! How can we get rid of him?

# Maybe a distraction?
That makes sense - what could distract him?

# Something that crocodiles like...
They'd like to eat you - so you'll need to show him why that's a bad idea.

# How do I do that?
Feed it something nasty!

# Where do I find something nasty, yet enticing?
You know someone who can make useful mixtures - maybe they can help?

## Who do I talk to?
You need to go back to the woods and talk to the old turtle lady.

## Where is she?
Fishing! You can find her in the same spot you kidnapped that poor crab.

# What is this thing she gave me?
It's a crocodile repellant.

# What do I do with it?
Go repel that crocodile!

## Tell me how to get rid of the crocodile.
Go back to the spot where it's giving you 'the look', and use the crocodile repellant in your inventory on it.

# Now what?
The river's clear for crossing!

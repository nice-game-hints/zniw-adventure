The nasty reptile is gone - so how do you cross the river?

# A raft?
Well, no, but your head's in the right place!

# Not a raft? Aw.
No, but the solution involves something you'd make a raft with!

## Like what?
Like the logs that you tie together to make a raft! Have a look around for logs.

## Tell me where to find the first log.
In an area south of the [crocodile that you sent packing.](croc.md)

When you're in this area, the log is close to some white flowers.

## Where is the second log?
In an area east of the crocodile that you sent packing.

When you're in this area, the log is on the northern side.

# Can I do anything else here?
You can go to the right for an unrelated puzzle, or talk to the Hesperonychus.

# What does he have to say?
Not much - he mostly gives you hints on how to cross the river, but that's my job!

# How do I use these logs?
Return to the area where you scared the crocodile off, and use the logs on the gaps between the small islands.

## Where is the third log?
There is no third log.

## So how do I get to the other side of the river?
Grab the first log you placed, and use it to bridge the gap to the final island.

# I made it!
Did you talk to the snake?

# Yep!
And did you give him the thing he wanted?

# Nope!
Then you'll need to get him some food!

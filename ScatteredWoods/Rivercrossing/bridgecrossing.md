He's ticklish, so climbing over this roadblock isn't an option. How can we cross the bridge now?

# What does the Euoplocephalus have to say for himself?
"How did you get stuck here?" - ^[He usually has no problem with crossing the bridge and eating tasty fruit in the nearby glade, but a Troodon gang got him stuck here.]
"Are there any other bridges around here?" - ^[Nope.]
"What happened to this place, anyway?" - ^[The formation of Wajapulka caused many of the locals to move away, leaving Rivenn-na to be swarmed by gangs and predators.]

## What else did he have to say?
"You mentioned your brother..." - ^[He's on the other side of the river, and the Euoplocephalus was meant to meet him near the Rivenn-na falls today.]

He also asked you for a favor.

# What was the favour?
He asked you to explain his situation to his brother when you cross the river - his brother is a red Euoplocephalus.

# So how do I get to the other side of the river?
There's plenty of places to explore - why not head over to the right?

## There's a few things going on here!
Indeed - below are some guides if you need them, just note that they should be read in order.

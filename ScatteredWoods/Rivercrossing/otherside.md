Sam's been fed, but how does that help you cross the river?

# What's Sam's deal?
He's a friendly snake, and has a plan to get both of you across the river after you [fed him.](snake.md)

# What did his plan need?
He needed two logs.

# How do I get the logs back?
You just need to select the 'take' option from the interaction submenu (holding left-click over them.)

## How do I get both logs back?
Go down one screen to pick up the first log, then back to Sam's island to get the other.

Give them both to him by going into your inventory, selecting 'use', and then clicking on Sam.

## Now what?
After giving him both logs, you've worked together to create a makeshift bridge to the other side of the river!

# Hooray!
Quickly get across the makeshift bridge!

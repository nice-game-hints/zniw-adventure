You've had a look around, and found a vicious Troodon gang near the bridge. What's up with them?

# They're blocking the bridge!
Damn, that means you can't save the blue Euoplocephalus!

Do you remember hearing about someone on this side of the river?

# Only sam's date...
The blue Euoplocephalus mentioned someone on this side of the river, too.

# In what context?
He had a favour to ask of you - something to tell them if you saw them.

# What was the favour?
He wanted you to explain his situation to his brother when you crossed the river.

He also said that they planned to meet each other near Rivenn-na falls.

# How did he describe his brother?
He said that they looked very similar to one another, except his brother is red.

## So what am I looking for?
You're looking for a red Euoplocephalus in the waterfall area.

You can find the waterfall on the west side of the riverbed.

# Found him!
Great! Talk to him and he will offer to help guide you through the area.

# Perfect!
Perfect indeed! The troodons have now been scared off, and you can help the blue Euoplocephalus!

# How do I do that?
Talk to the red Euoplocephalus again to begin the rescue mission.

This forest isn't so bad after all - a kindly old turtle gave you some advice and asked that you complete an errand for her.

# What does she want?
She wants a pine cone and some white flowers.

# Where do I find the pine cone?
Do you remember seeing one earlier?

# Nope!
Pine cones grow on trees - did you get a good look at the trees around the paths?

# It's a forest. There are hundreds of trees.
That's a fair point. The pine cone was near something close to the ground that may have been distracting you.

# Tell me where to find the pine cone.
It's on a tree close to where you met the Hesperonychus and may have been distracted by the creepy eyes in the bushes.

You'll see it clearly if you keep your eyes on the treeline.

## How do I get the pine cone?
Zniw is too short to reach it - maybe you can boost your height?

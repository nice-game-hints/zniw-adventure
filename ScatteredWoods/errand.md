This forest isn't so bad after all - a kindly old turtle gave you some advice and asked that you complete an errand for her.

# What does she want?
She wants a pine cone and some white flowers.

# Where do I find white flowers?
When you were exploring earlier, you may have seen some.

# I don't remember seeing any white flowers.
Did you check all three paths? Left, middle, right?

## Tell me where to find the white flowers.
They're easy to spot while travelling on the middle path, and should fit nicely in your backpack!

If you still don't have a backpack, see [this guide](backpack.md) for help with making one.

There may be other things to see on this path, too.

## What else can I find on this path?
A withered branch, directly left of the flowers - it blends in well, but be sure to grab it!

# Where do I find the pine cone?
Do you remember seeing one earlier?

# Nope!
Pine cones grow on trees - did you get a good look at the trees around the paths?

# It's a forest. There are hundreds of trees.
That's a fair point. The pine cone was on a tree above some rather distracting bushes.

# Tell me where to find the pine cone.
It's on a tree close to where you met the Hesperonychus and may have been distracted by the creepy eyes in the bushes.

You'll see it clearly if you keep your eyes on the treeline.

# How do I get the pine cone?
Zniw is too short to reach it - maybe she needs to extend her reach a bit?

# How do I do that?
The stick just isn't long enough - maybe if something was on the end of it, you'd reach the pine cone?

# What should I put on the end of the stick?
Something snappy - the angrier, the better!

## Tell me where to find a snappy thing.
To the left of the turtle, you'll find a crab in a sand burrow - use your stick on it to acquire a perfect pinecone-pilfering partner.

# Hooray!
Now go and give the turtle lady the things she asked for!

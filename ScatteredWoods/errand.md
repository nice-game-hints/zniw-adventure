This forest isn't so bad after all - a kindly old turtle gave you some advice and asked that you complete an errand for her.

# What does she want?
She wants a pine cone and some white flowers.

# I'll do my best - but for now, how do I get out of this forest?
There are three possible paths to take (left, middle, and right) - why not do a bit of exploring?

Civilisation feels so far - and it is! How do you get around this strange forest?

# Where should I start?
The sign said Rivenn-na falls was 2km away. We should be trying to close that distance.

Oh, and don't forget to grab the object of Zniw's desire!

# Object? What object? Where?
The interesting rock that Zniw was chasing in the cutscene - it's on the ground, right side of the clearing you woke up in.

Note that these pebbles are optional and only used to unlock bonus content in the Extras menu. See if you can find them all by yourself!

# I'll do my best - but for now, how do I get out of this forest?
There are three possible paths to take (left, middle, and right) - why not do a bit of exploring?

# I have taken the path on the right!
And what did you see?

# Aww, a sleepy dinosaur!
He's got wings - maybe he can tell you which way civilisation is?

# OI!! WAKE UP!
That was quite rude of you. Anyway, this is what the Hesperonychus tells you:

"Do you know how to get to Wajapulka?" ^[It's a long walk, over the river in the northern part of the woods.]
"Where am I, anyway?" ^[The scattered woods!]
"How do I get out of this place?" ^[Go to the northern part of the woods and cross the bridge.]
"You mentioned 'preparing properly'..." ^[Look for rope, food supplies, rocks to start a fire - and make yourself a backpack.]

# How do I make a backpack?
Making a backpack would be a good start - see [this guide](backpack.md) for hints on making a backpack.

# 

# Where do I find something big and durable?
Have you been down the left path yet?

# Yes, but not much here...
And did you follow it all the way to the left?

# Ah!
The clue's in the name of one of the things you can interact with here!

## How do I take these durable leaves?
Assuming you've tried and been met with a kind old turtle, her responses were:

"Is that your place?" ^[Yes, it's her home and humble shop! Just don't even think about swimming in the nearby river.]
"Can I take these leaves?" ^[Yes! They were just there temporarily.]
"Do you know how to create a backpack?" ^[She echoes the Hesperonychus' sentiment - something durable to hold items, and a strap to keep it on your back.]
"About the husband you mentioned..." ^[He's been missing for months after checking on the pterosaurs in the area.]

She also asked you to go on an errand.

# What was the errand?
You need to collect a pine cone and some white flowers for her. 

See [this guide](errand.md) for help with finding them.

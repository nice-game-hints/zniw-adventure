Errand completed, directions received - it's time to get out of this forest!

# What were her directions?
She told you that a hidden path was behind a boulder next to the signpost - it's hard to spot due to all the shrubs and bushes, but searching will reveal it with ease.

# Can you show me the boulder?
Certainly! Click the question mark to see a picture. ^[ ![Boulder image](Boulder.PNG)]

# I see it - how do I travel past it?
In the interaction menu, release your mouse over the magnifying glass icon.

## What do I do with this red fruit?
Eat it! Eating red fruit like this and then checking the 'story so far' tab (the icon beneath the pause icon on the top-left side of the screen) will tell you how many pebbles are left to find in the area you're in.

Remember that these pebbles don't have a direct gameplay benefit, they just unlock extras like concept art that can be accessed from the extras tab in the main menu.

## And the cycas cone?
You can't eat it or really do anything with it - in fact, travelling down the secret path will remove it from your inventory anyway.

It was added to your encyclopedia, though, so if you're curious about the flora of the prehistoric era then you can read all about it!

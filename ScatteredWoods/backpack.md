You've been told to make a backpack twice now - so how do you do it?

# What do I need to make a backpack?
You'll need something big and durable to hold your stuff, and a strap to carry it all on your back.

# Where do I find a strap?
You may find something useful if you continue walking down the path.

## Tell me where to find a strap.
In the 'Scattered Woods Turn' (found at the end of the middle and right paths), you can grab a Vine that will act as a strap.

# Where do I find something big and durable?
Have you been down the left path yet?

# Yes, but not much here...
And did you follow it all the way to the left?

# Ah!
The clue's in the name of one of the things you can interact with here!

## How do I take these durable leaves?
Assuming you've tried and been met with a kind old turtle, her responses were:

"Is that your place?" ^[Yes, it's her home and humble shop! Just don't even think about swimming in the nearby river.]
"Can I take these leaves?" ^[Yes! They were just there temporarily.]
"Do you know how to create a backpack?" ^[She echoes the Hesperonychus' sentiment - something durable to hold items, and a strap to keep it on your back.]
"About the husband you mentioned..." ^[He's been missing for months after checking on the pterosaurs in the area.]

She also asked you to go on an errand.

# What was the errand?
You need to collect a pine cone and some white flowers for her.

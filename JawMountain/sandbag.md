The decoy is wonderful, but not quite enough - how can we get the Azhdarchid to stick around after attacking it?

# Grabbing him?
That would be a great way to get yourself eaten.

# Hitting him with something?
That's more like it! Do you have anything that could be thrown?

# Leaves?
Throwing leaves at someone is a bit pathetic. Could you fill them with something?

# Like what?
Something dense - have a look around for something that could fit inside a leaf and make it heavier.

## Tell me what to fill the leaves with.
There was a pile of sand near the landslide - fill each of your leaves with sand to make sandbags.

# I can't wait to see the look on his face!
Me neither - rush back to the sunny spot of the forest slope and put your decoy down.

You'll need to be quick to get him, so be ready to open the inventory and THROW!

Don't worry if he flies off again - ^[You can make more sand bags by gathering more leaves from the plant on the slope and filling them with sand.]

# Is there anything else I need to know?
Hitting him won't be enough - you should try to restrain him, too.

## How do I restrain him?
Use the other piece of long vine to keep him on the ground!

# Hooray!
The evil-doer has fallen right into the mud pit!

# What now?
He might thrash free - find a way to knock him out!

# By the power of sandbag?
No, something that can deliver a mighty THWACK!

# Where do I find something like that?
It's very close - look for something that might have been damaged in all the scrambling.

## What do I hit him with?
The nearby signpost was damaged by the fight and can be grabbed - use it on the Azhdarchid

# POW!
That's a wrap!

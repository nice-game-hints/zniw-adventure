Finally, we have a work of modern (yet prehistoric) art! But where should it go?

# Into my heart, forever?
Wow, you got attached quickly - remember, it's supposed to be somewhere the Azhdarchid can see it.

# Where can he see, again?
Anywhere that it's sunny - you've been sticking to the shadows and undergrowth the whole time.

## Tell me where to put the decoy.
On the sunny northern section of the forest slope.

# Hooray!
Unfortunately, that wasn't quite enough - you'll need to [hit the Azhdarchid](sandbag.md) with something too.

The Azhdarchid is hunting you from above - stick to the shade and gather everything you can find! This guide will talk you through finding every useful item in the area.

# Where can I go?
From your starting position, your options are limited - any paths around you aren't very obvious, as the trees and bushes grow wild.

# What am I looking for?
A hidden path between the bushes and trees.

# Where can I find something like that?
South - move your mouse over the bushes and trees in the shade and you can move through them.

# What now?
These sunny spots are still mostly obscured by the trees - you can explore this area at will.

# What am I looking for in this area?
1) Something colourful
2) Another secret path obscured by greenery

## Where do I find something colourful?
The paths here make up a square, and in the middle of it you can find (and take) some Yellow Ochre.

# Where might I find the secret path?
It may help to follow the paths you *can* see, treating them like a partially-obscured maze puzzle; see where they logically lead.

## Tell me where to go.
Southwest of this square path, one of the offshoots takes you around a curve and past a mud splash. This path also leads down into a new 'forest path' area.

If you're curious about the mud splash, ^[It is just hiding an optional pebble and can be ignored.]

# What can I find on the forest path?
Two items and two exits.

# What are the two items?
1) Something colourful
2) Something long.

## Tell me what the items are and where to find them.
1) The yellow fern leaves are the first thing you see when entering the area, on the right.
2) The long vine is wrapped around a tree on the left.

# Tell me about the eastern path.
This is the forest slope - only the southern part is shady enough to walk in safely.

# What can I find here?
Four identical and familiar items, and a path to another area.

## What are they?
Durable leaves from a plant on the far right of the area.

# Tell me about the additional area here.
The exit is on the far right of the forest slope, and it's a mud pit.

# What can I find here?
1) Something long
2) Something circular

## What are these items?
1) A withered stick, clearly visible in the mud.
2) An oval stone, clearly visible in the mud.

There's not much else to do here for now, so head back to the forest path.

# Tell me about the western path.
This path leads to a dead end - but there's still some useful things available! 

# What can I find here?
1) Something on the ground
2) Something just out of reach
3) Something familiar and long
4) Something small
5) A stable working surface

## What are these items?
1) A stick on the ground, clearly visible on the left
2) A stick dangling from the tree, just out of reach (Agu will get it for you)
3) A long vine wrapped aroudn the tree with the stick dangling from it
4) Round stones that are found when trying to 'take' a stone from the landslide
5) The oddly-shaped rock - you can't take it with you, but it is a good start for your plan.

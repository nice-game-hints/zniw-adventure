Agu's plan involves bringing the Azhdarchid  down to earth - but to do that, you'll need to make a decoy that will catch his eye.

# What do I need?
[This guide](path.md) will guide you through finding every item you need.

# My backpack is well-stocked - where do I start?
The dead-end path has a good starting point.

# What am I looking for?
The oddly-shaped rock next to the landslide - you can use it to contain your paint.

# How do I do that?
A good first step would be putting some paint in it!

## How do I use my items to do that?
The Ochre will create a yellow pigment if you crush it up on the rock.

# How do I do that?
Use the Yellow Ochre on the rock, then use the oval stone on it to crush it up. 

# What now?
Use the Oval Stone on the paint to change its colour.

# What's up with this yellow oval stone?
Doesn't it kind of look like Zniw's head?

# Not really.
Well of course not - it's missing the eyes! Don't you have something that could look like eyes?

## What do I have that can look like eyes?
The two round stones! Combine them with the yellow oval stone to create a head piece.

# What now?
We can't use the oddly-shaped rock as a body - maybe we can create one ourselves?

# What kind of body?
Nothing fancy - just something that could hold up a stone without falling over, and stand firmly on the ground.

# What do I have that could do that?
Those three sticks could be a good start - but they're not tied together very well.

# How do I tie the sticks together?
Use either of the pieces of vine in your inventory to create a stable tripod.

# Now what? 
You have a head, you have a body - put them together!

# Hmm...
Yeah, even for an Azhdarchid  with bad eyesight, it's not very convincing. Maybe there's a way to cover the sticks?

# How do I do that?
The yellow fern leaves would be great! Unfortunately, there's nothing sticking them to the tripod.

## How do I stick the leaves onto the tripod?
Dip them in the mud pit to the far east, then attach them to the tripod.

# Hooray!

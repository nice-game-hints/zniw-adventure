The game begins with a predicament - Zniw wants to buy the flowers for her mom, but the Lambeosaurus in the queue is slowing things down.

# How do I speed things up?
Why not talk to him, see what's taking him so long?

# How do I talk to him?
Move the mouse over him, then hold down left click - in this new sub-menu, release the mouse over the speech icon.

# I know what he's looking for.
Ah yes, the dinosaur is missing his wallet. From asking about its appearance, you know that it's ^["Pink, with a decorative light dot pattern."]

You also know that he's only recently lost the wallet, so maybe it's still in the area?

# How do I move?
When your cursor has lit up green, left click and you'll move to that spot.

# Where should I start looking?
This area is quite small - why not search from left to right?

## Tell me where to find the wallet.
You find the wallet behind the merchandise directly next to the bouquet - hold left click on it and release over the magnifying glass icon.

# How do I give the wallet back to the Lambeosaurus?
Open your inventory in the top left by holding left click on it.

From there, release click over the hand icon to 'take' it, and click on the Lambeosaurus to give it to him.

## My good deed for the day!
C'mon, you should know by now - no good deed goes [unpunished.](/ScatteredWoods/index.md)

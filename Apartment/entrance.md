The home of the enemy! There's no dinosaur-themed live-laugh-love signs, so he MUST be evil!

# What do we have here?
Here we have a big bookshelf, and not much else.

# If I were a bond villain...
You would probably hide something behind the bookcase, yes.

# What do I do with the bookcase?
The chief seems to be a GOOD bond villain, so it's probably best to come back later when you know more about his favourite books.

## I have explored further into the apartment.
Then you've made it to the bedroom, opened the middle shelf, and found a randomised note that relates to these books?

# Yup.
You need to check two specific books - the descriptions on the note refer to one book each.

# What does the colour refer to?
The literal colour of the book - if you're struggling to find one, move your mouse across the rows until you find one that is the colour you want and actually interactable.

## Give me a list matching the note's colour specification to an actual book.
Clicking the question mark will reveal the book's name and position.

yellow - ^[Fungilla Chronicle - second-to-bottom shelf, on the left side]
black - ^[Captain Disaster in The Dark Side of the Moon - third-to-bottom shelf, on the right side]
blue - ^[Eternal Ocean - Bottom shelf, furthest book on the left.]
green - ^[Flora Of Polisemia - Third shelf down, on the left side.]
red - ^[Tales For Children - Third shelf down, slanted in the middle.]
white - ^[Far North Scenery - Third shelf down, on the right side.]

When you've found the book, 'Search' it by using the magnifying glass in the interaction menu.

# What does the other description on the note refer to?
It refers to the dinosaur that has either written or is mentioned by the book - an easy example is the 'skilled flyer' matching Aviation Physics.

If your knowledge of dinosaurs is lacking, you may struggle here.

## Give me a list matching the author description to an actual book.
Clicking the question mark will reveal the book's name and position.

osteoderms - ^[Tales For Children - Third shelf down, slanted in the middle.]
ceratopsian - ^[Far North Scenery - Third shelf down, right side.]
frightful lizard - ^[In The Jaws Of Daspletosaurus - Second shelf down, on the right.]
long crest - ^[Music Theory For Beginners - Second shelf down, in the middle.]
crocodilian - ^[Basics Of Self-Defense: Wetlands - Bottom shelf, right side.]
skilled flyer - ^[Aviation Physics: an introduction  - Second-to-bottom shelf, left side.]

When you've found the book, 'Search' it by using the magnifying glass in the interaction menu.

# Now what?
Two clicks, rather unusual - have a look around the apartment and see if anything has changed or appeared.

## What did solving the book puzzle do?
The safe in the office is now unlocked. See [this guide](office.md) if you didn't find the safe already.

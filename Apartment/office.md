A Dinosaur with an office space - now I've seen everything.

# What do we have here?
A desk with three drawers, a book, a plant, and a map.

# Something is tingling...
Your stealing senses! The drawers must have something good in them, then.

# Just ink.
Check all three drawers, one of them is bound to have something useful.

## What does this mean?
The writing on the piece of paper you found in the middle drawer is RANDOMISED - you will need to figure out a solution yourself, or return to [this guide](entrance.md) for help.

For a nudge in the right direction, click the question mark. ^[the descriptions on the paper are closely related to the books in the entrance.]

# What else can I find in the bedroom?
The map on the wall seems interesting.

# What can I do with the map?
Get a closer look at the post it notes - one of them may stand out.

## What do I do with this information?
Memorise the number of unique mushrooms found in the location marked with a red X.

## What else can I do with the map?
Try to 'take' it to reveal something underneath.

# How do I get into the safe?
The office only holds half the answer - return to the [entrance](entrance.md) if the safe is still locked.

# What do I do with this?
You've opened the safe, and found a pentagon stone - if the answer isn't immediately obvious, have a look around the apartment some more.

If you can't figure it out, [this guide](livingroom.md) may help.

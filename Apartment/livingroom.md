A place usually reserved for relaxing is definitely hiding more than it seems...

# What do we have here?
There's containers, shelves, a child's drawing and a large tapestry here.

# Tell me what to look out for here.
If you made a mess on a wall and wanted to hide it, what would you do?

# Redecorate?
Basically, yes - look for something on the wall that's been hidden.

## Tell me what you mean.
The tapestry can be folded to reveal a RANDOMISED CODE. Do your best to remember it.

# Is there anything else in this room?
There is - and it's significantly harder to move.

# The plushie wasn't THAT hard to move.
The plushie is ^[only used for an optional pebble] - I was talking about something else.

## Tell me what I need to do.
Get Agu to move the withered fern onto the floor, and then ask him to move the entire wardrobe to reveal a safe.

# How do I get in?
The pentagon symbol seems suspicious - maybe you should return when you have something pentagon-shaped?

## I have something pentagon shaped.
Nice! Put it into the living room safe to begin cracking it open.

# What now?
This seems like a prehistoric-themed modern day safe - you'll need to rotate the dial left and right until you have the correct combination.

There also seems to be a strange button that you can press a set number of times.

# How do I rotate the dials?
You must press the up arrows to increase the number of dial turns on that side.

To make things a bit more confusing, the correct combination is randomised.

# Where do I find the combination for the safe?
You found it earlier - it's underneath the tapestry.

## What does the tapestry code mean?
It tells you the number of times that the dials need to be turned - for example, my code was 6L6R which meant six turns left, and six turns right.

# What about the button?
Do you remember seeing a specific nubmer anywhere in the apartment?

# Only the numbers on the safe combination...
There was also some single numbers on the a in the home office.

# Can I see the number again?
You can go back into the office and check - look for something on the map that stands out.

## Which one of these numbers do I need?
The number of unique mushrooms found in the area marked with an X (Mine was 4, but this may be randomised) is the number of times you need to push the mysterious button on the safe.

## So in clear terms, how do I get into the safe?
1) Look at the code under the tapestry in the living room. Memorise the numbers next to the letter L and letter R.
2) Look at the post it note marked with an X on the office's map. Memorise the number of unique mushrooms found in that region.
3) Press the up arrows on the left and right so that they match the note's L and R values.
4) Press the arrows next to the button in the bottom right so the number matches the number of unique mushrooms in the region marked with an X.

# Hooray!
The criminal lifestyle is pretty cool!

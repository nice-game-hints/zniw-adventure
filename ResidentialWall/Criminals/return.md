The Metal Gear Solid music is optional - we're on our way back to the wall!

# Which way do I go again?
Into the market, up the street on the right, and up onto the rooftop.

# How do I get back onto the rooftop again?
Use the grappling hook on the lone rock.

## I'm back inside!
This is what the little Albertadromeus had to say:

"What's the deal with those glowshrooms?" ^[He's not sure, but has seen several of them being carried throughout the halls at night.]
"The 'scary creature'?" ^[A huge creature with a large beak - Agu seemed to think the description was familiar.]
"Why are there no guards around here?" ^[Security has relaxed a bit since the thief was caught. Bartholomew is guarding the mushrooms, and Steffan is guarding the basement.]

## What else did he have to say?
"That's why you were peeking through the door?" ^[He was just looking for his Zauroforce comic book.]

## Now what?
If you give him the comic book we found earlier, he will give you the key to the [door.](guard.md)

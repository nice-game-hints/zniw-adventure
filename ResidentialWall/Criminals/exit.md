The guard at the main entrance is probably prepared to stop you this time.

# Which way do I go, again?
At the top of the stairs, you're basically in the area that the Chasmosaurus was blocking earlier.

Head to the left a couple times to re-trace your steps.

## Ah.
While Agu gets through the door, you're tasked with finding the second key; it's somewhere in the village, and has a 'small stone attached to it.'

# Where should I start?
Agu mentioned the lake being a great place to look, and his notebook seemed to have it singled out.

Leaving through the main entrance isn't really a viable option, though.

# Where can I go, then?
Head south into the storage area. 

# Now what?
Aren't your axe senses tingling?

## What do I use the axe on?
The string keeping the third door shut can be cut with the axe, giving you access to the room.

# What am I generally looking for in this room?
1) Something rocky.
2) A book that is actually fun to read.
3) A way to reach the window.

## What, specifically, am I looking for in this room?
1) The lodestone that makes up part of the toy can be found on the shelf.
2) The comic book is found among the stack on another shelf.
3) The mound of sacks can be stacked up to the window.

# Hooray!
The village is pretty at night... but we have a [job to do!](lake.md)

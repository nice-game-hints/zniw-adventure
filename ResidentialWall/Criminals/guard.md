The only thing standing between you and the door to the Chief's apartment is another guard - how can you get rid of him?

# Kill him!
Wow, steady on. Why not try to scare him off, or distract him?

# Alright, just this once.
This is the same guy who was sorting through the food stocks earlier - what do you know about him?

# That he hates Steffan?
He's a little ball of hatred, sure - but what else does he hate?

# His job?
Jobs sucking is usually a result of bad working conditions. 

# Hmmm.
Maybe you could ruin his night be causing a problem he thinks he already solved?

## What do I distract the guard with?
A mammal running loose among the food supplies would definitely cause a distraction!

# Where do I find a mammal?
There doesn't seem to be many on this floor, does there?

# No, that's why I'm asking.
Alright. Why not search top-to-bottom?

## Tell me where to find a mammal.
On your way to the basement, a mammal can be found at the top of the stairs.

# How do I capture it?
You'll need a bit of bait, and something to trap him with.

# Hmm...
You already have everything you need in your inventory - if not, it can all be found in the basement.

## Tell me how to trap the mammal.
Place the bowl of worms near the curtain, and trap him with the piece of cloth when he's distracted.

# Now what?
Set the little critter loose in a place that would distract the guard!

# How do I do that?
Use the critter on the guard - you can get quite far into the room without him noticing you.

# Now what?
He's not going to be distracted forever!

## How do I lock him in?!
Use the piece of wood next to the door, and use it on the door to barricade it shut.

# Where to now?
The [chief's apartment](/Apartment/index.md) is unguarded, and Agu has the key!

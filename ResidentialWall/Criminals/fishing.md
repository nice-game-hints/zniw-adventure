Get the Metal Gear music off, and some calm tunes on - we're chilling at the lake!

# Ack! A witness! Kill him!
Easy, killer - this old turtle might remind you of someone.

# Oh, is he who I think he is?
Most likely. Why not talk to him to find out?

## What does he have to say?
"Are you the husband of the potion shop's owner?" ^[He is, and misses her dearly.]
"Have you heard about the recent events?" ^[Not really - all he knows is that the thief was apparently caught today.]
"Are you fishing for a living?" ^[He is, for sustenance and shells by selling excess fish to the pantry and markets.]

## What else did he have to say?
"How did you end up in the village?" ^[He was investigating the disappearance of Pterosaurs in the region, and the village was closed soon after he arrived.]
"Has something been stolen from you?" ^[No, he doesn't really have anything worth stealing!]

# Now what?
The key clearly isn't hanging out in clear view - where else could it be?

# In the tent?
Does this kindly old turtle really seem like he'd have the key?

He may have something that can help you find it, though.

# Like what?
Something to make searching the water easier.

## Tell me what I need to find the key.
You need to use the fishing rod.


# How will that help me find the key?
On its own, it won't.

Maybe you have something that can bring the key to you?

If you're curious about the bowl of worms in this context, ^[They're only used to get an optional 'fishing' pebble.] - but may be useful later, too.

## Tell me how to fish up the key.
The lodestone has magnetic qualities - attach it to the fishing rod and try fishing in any spot!

# Now what?
Be a good citizen and put the rod back against the shack, then head back to the Residential Wall and give the key to Agu!

It seems unlikely that the chief would leave a key under his doormat - how will you get in?

# Please don't say...
I'm sorry, but it's true. You have to talk to THAT guy.

## Uggggh. What does Steffan have to say?
"What's behind that door?" ^[The chief's apartment - and he does NOT want to be disturbed today.]
"Why was the access to the building restricted?" ^[As usual, it's the thief's fault - and the building will remain closed until the investigation is over. It hasn't even started yet, however.]
"Can't you help your buddy over there?" ^[He's not a friend, he's a slacker! There is definitely some drama here.]

# Damn, he really doesn't like that other guy.
Isn't it awful when people speak ill of others, literally behind their backs?

# Sounds like some real drama.
And confrontations between people that hate each other usually get quite loud.

## Tell me what to do.
Speak to the busy Orodromeus that was looking for the mammal to cause a confrontation.

# Hooray!
You've been invited inside! Nice!

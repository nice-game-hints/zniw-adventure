After some light exploring, you've likely come across some locked areas - none as enticing as the one behind a solid door that's locked up tight.

# How do I get in?
You aren't going to break the door open, Zniw is pretty scrawny.

# So what do I need?
A key!

# Can I get a hint for finding the key?
Which stereotypical spot are humans always hiding their keys?

## Tell me where to find the key.
Under the doormat right in front of the door.

# What is this place?
You've just unlocked access to the warehouse.

If you're curious about the furball - ^[Finding it rewards you with an optional pebble, nothing more.]

# What else is over here?
Head to the left and you'll find additional ['restricted'](chiefroom.md) areas.

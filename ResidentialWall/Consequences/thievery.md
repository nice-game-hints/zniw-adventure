Your new friend is clearly having a bad influence on you! To be fair, Zniw was already a kleptomaniac. So you might as well steal everything that isn't nailed down.

# What am I looking for?
1) Your backpack, with everything except the grappling hook missing.
2) A key.
3) A piece of string.
4) One half of something either useful (or terrifying? Both?)

## Where do I find those items?
1) Your backpack is next to where you found the rocks, atop a rock-y thing.
2) The key and container is in the left part of the cupboard.
If you're curious about the cup, ^[it's only used to get an optional 'gardening' pebble and can safely be left in the cupboard.]
3) The piece of string is in the basket in the bottom right part of the room. Agu will need to get it for you.
4) The axe head is on a shelf very close to your backpack.

# Now what?
Do you remember finding a possible exit in this room?

# I only have half an axe...
And a full partner in crime!

## Tell me how to leave the storage room
Get Agu to pull the shabby wooden door in the previous area (where you found your backpack) off its hinges.

# Woah, that's a lot of stuff!
And it's all so easy to steal!

# What am I looking for in here?
1) Something often used for cleaning
2) Something often used for eating (if you're gross)
3) Something wooden.

## Where do I find those items?
1) The cloth is on the corner of a table near the door
2) The bowl of worms is on a stool near the notice board
3) The wooden handle is on the top shelf inside a locker on the right side of the room

# Now what?

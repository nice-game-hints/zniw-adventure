Outside of the cell, but not out of the frying pan or fire - first order of business is getting rid of the guard.

# What do I need?
Well, you should get everything that seems useful first.

1) Something that you can throw.
2) Something used for tidying.

## What are those items?
1) The small rocks, shown in the environment as rubble
2) A broom.

# All stocked up - now what?
This puzzle is actually quite similar to one you solved in the cave.

# I don't have a torch to turn on and off...
Well, no, but you have a handful of rocks.

# Tell me what to do with the rocks.
'Use' them on the guard, then throw them at various things in the environment to distract him.

# Hmm...
Nothing seems to be distracting him for long - curses, dinosaurs that are good at their jobs are the worst!

If only you knew someone with more experience in causing distractions...

## Tell me what to do next.
You know a skilled criminal! Asking his advice seems wise.

# Now what?
Stefan has moved across the room - throwing rocks again seems like a good idea.

## What do I throw them at?
The small tunnel on the right side of the room can now have stones thrown at it - might as well!

# Hmmm...
He doesn't stay away for long enough to explore the room - is there a way you can keep him out?

# I don't know, is there?
Don't you have something that could jam the little door shut?

## How do I keep Stefan out of the room?
When he scurries down the tunnel, use the broom to keep the door shut.

# Hooray!
Better keep up your end of the bargain and let Agu out!

Axes are cool. Need I say more?

# Say no more - except telling me how to make it.
Assuming you've followed [these hints,](thievery.md) then you've got everything you need to make the axe!

## Tell me how to make the axe.
Combine the axe head with the wooden handle to get the complete axe.

# Axes like this are not cool.
Agreed. How can we make it more secure?

# Glue?
Come on, we're dinosaurs. Something a bit more primitive.

## Tell me how to secure the axe.
The string is what we need.

# Where do I use the axe?
Have you found a use for the copper key yet?

# Nope.
Look around the far edge of the room for something keyhole-shaped.

# A-ha!
Now that you're in the new room, the thing you need to use the axe on must be pretty obvious.

## Tell me what to use the axe on.
The big wooden beam keeping the door shut.

# Hooray!
Freedom! Now you can have a quick chat with Agu.

## What are his responses?
"Just who exactly are you?" ^[A member of the merchant guild of Metallonia, the industrial city in the far north.]
"You mentioned an investigation before..." ^[The village suddenly closing when he arrived seems far too suspicious - and the chief wasn't as kind as the stories made him out to be.]

## What else did he have to say?
"Why did you steal all that stuff?" ^[It was the only way to survive - and he planned to give the items back later.]
"So, the chief's a bad guy, then?" ^[If he isn't, then it's a very, very large coincidence.]
"Anything else I should know about?" ^[Stay as stealthy as possible - the plan involves breaking into the chief's apartment for a key.]

# Now what?
Head up the stairs and get into the chief's apartment!

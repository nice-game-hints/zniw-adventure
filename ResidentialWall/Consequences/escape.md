Seriously, they didn't have more than one cell?

# Can my Shawshank be redeemed?
This isn't that kind of movie. Have a look around the cell anyway.

Remember that you don't have a backpack anymore - we're back to only being able to carry one item at a time.

# What am I looking for?
1) Several sources of light
2) A place to hold them

## What do I do?
1) The lightsources are, of course, the glowing mushrooms in three spots around the cave.
2) The place to hold them is the basket on the left side of the cell, near the door.

# Now what?
The light revealed something on a shelf above the door.

# Not again!
Yep, Zniw is too short to reach up to the shelf.

# Guess we're rotting in this cell.
Not so fast! You can try to grab it, and remember - you're not the only one in the cell!

## How do I get the item on the shelf?
Try to grab it yourself, then ask Agu to grab it for you.

# What's this?
When I said this wasn't a 'Shawshank-y' kind of movie... I might have lied for dramatic effect.

# Where do I use the spoon?
There's no shortage of rocks on the wall to use it on!

## Which rock do I use the spoon on?
The largest rock touching the ground is looser than the others.

# Now what?
It's a bit too heavy for Zniw to move, so unfortunately, you'll need to ask Agu for help again.

# Hooray!
We're not quite out of the prison yet, but the cell has been [left in the dust!](distraction.md)

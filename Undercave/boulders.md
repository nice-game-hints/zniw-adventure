You've lit up your surroundings, and ventured deeper into the cave - but now, heavy boulders block your path.

# Damn, damn, damn, damn!
Calm down! Have you considered checking out the other cave?

# Other cave?
You had two paths to explore - the boulders block the left path, but what about the right?

## I have explored the right path.
And you found the scrawlings on the wall, next to a long-dead dinosaur.

# What a terrible fate...
Indeed. Well, skeletons don't need their items!

# Wow, okay, cold.
So are his bones. Grab the stuff.

## What am I taking?
The long rope and some pieces of wood.

# What do I do with these?
Individually, they're not very useful.

## Tell me what to do with the rope and wood.
Combine them, of course!

# What now?
You have a ladder - and there's a perfect place to use it, not far from here!

# Hmm...
Do you remember a trickle of sunlight anywhere in the cave?

## Tell me where to use the ladder.
In the fresh air cave, all the way to the right, you need to use the ladder and climb your way out.

## Freedom!
Not quite - but the boulders that blocked your path into the left cave are now gone.

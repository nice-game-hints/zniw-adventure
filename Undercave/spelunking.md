As caves go, this one's pretty nasty - but still worth exploring!

# Where should I start?
Most paths are too dark to follow safely for now - why not look for a light source?

# Where should I look for a light source?
There's only one direction to progress in for now - walk east until you find the items that you'll need to make a torch.

# Can I have a guide for making the torch!
Certainly! Click [here](torch.md) for a guide on creating (and lighting) a torch.

# How do I use the map, again?
The square icon in the top right will open a map of the current area.

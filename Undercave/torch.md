It's smelly, creepy, and dark - thankfully, we can do something about that last one.

# What do I need to make a torch?
You need something to set on fire, something flammable, something to keep the flame burning, and something to start the fire.

# Where do I find something to set on fire?
Have you entered the smelly cave?

## Yep! What do I need from it?
The bone would be a good start - it'd save you from setting your own arm on fire! 

Pick up the bone.

# It doesn't seem very flammable...
Did you find out what was making this part of the cave smelly?

# Nope!
On the right side of the smelly cave, you can find a 'petroleum seep'.

## What do I do with the petroleum seep?
Dunk the bone in it to get a 'soaked bone!'

# Is there anything else I need in this cave?
There might be something you overlooked on the ground.

## What else is in this cave?
A flat stone (AKA Pyrite) is laying on the right side of the smelly cave.

# Now what?
Explore further to the right - this cave is deep!

## What can I do here?
In this 'fresh air cavern', there are a few things to see - dry leaves on the ground, and a pointy stone just out of reach.

Both are useful for making the torch.

# What do I do with the leaves?
Remember - we needed something that would keep the flame burning.

## Tell me how to use the leaves.
In your inventory, 'use' the soaked bone on the leaves to combine them. These leafy friends will keep your torch burning, as a bone on its own doesn't have much kindling potential.

# What about the stone?
It's a little bit too high for Zniw to reach.

# Hmm...
Maybe you can knock it down somehow?

## Tell me how to get the pointy stone.
Use the bone to safely knock the stone into your hand.

# What do I do with this stone?
Remember - we needed something that would start the fire.

## Tell me how to use the pointy stone.
Combine it with the flat stone in your inventory to create a 'portable fire starting kit' AKA Flint and Pyrite.

# Okay, now what?
You've got everything you need to make the torch!

## How do I light the torch?
Combine the Flint and Pyrite with the Soaked Bone to get a lit torch.

You can now light and extinguish the torch at will, by clicking the torch icon in the top left.

You've ventured deeper into the cave, and a boulder that could clear the path for you is currently being kept in position by a stick. How do you move it?

# How do I move the stick from here?
Do you have anything you could throw?

# Like what?
Something small that Zniw could throw with force.

## What do I use to dislodge the stick?
Use the small rocks we found in [this guide](acrossthechasm.md) on the wall to begin throwing them.

# Hmm...
It seems the stick and boulder are too firm to be jostled by mere rocks. What else can you throw your rocks at?

Mild spoiler - ^[Moving your mouse over everything may reveal the answer.]

# I can't find anything else to throw my rocks at.
Extinguishing your torch may be a good idea.

## Tell me what to throw the rocks at.
The wall! It's an obscure solution, but throwing the rocks at the wall will weaken it.

# Why can't I hit anything all of a sudden?
It's hard to throw things in the dark!

^[Make sure your torch is lit, or Zniw's throws will miss. They'll even miss the wall, somehow.]

# The wall has been weakened!
Fantastic! That may have given you new things to throw your rocks at.

## What will knock the stick away?
The stalagmites above the boulder will knock the stick away. Throw your rocks at them.

# Hooray!
New path revealed! Don't forget to pick up the item ^[a heavy rock] that was inside the boulder when it cracked open.

# What is on the path ahead?
See [this guide](leaving.md) for those answers.

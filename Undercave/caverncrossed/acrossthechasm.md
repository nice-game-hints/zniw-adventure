The ladder's snapped and you're the first to make it this far in years - what now?

## Is there truly no way back?
Sadly, no - but you should take the single twig near the chasm to remember your ladder by.

# What do we have here?
There are a couple paths to travel on here (left and right) - why not have a look around?

# What should I look for on the right path?
The only thing here is a collectable pebble.

If you want to know how to find it, click the question mark. ^[Extinguish your torch and grab it from the wall.]

# What should I look for on the left path?
Something to take with you.

## What do I take from the left path?
The small rocks on the left side of the room.

# Is there anything else here...?
There's more to this room than meets the eye - are you afraid of the dark?

# No!
Prove it.

## What are you getting at?
Extinguish your torch to find the hidden path forward.

Mild spoilers for this area - ^[Get used to it - a few puzzles here are tied to extinguishing and re-lighting your torch in the right contexts.]

## Can I have a navigation guide for this new area?
Certainly!

There are three paths to take here; going left is marked as a 'dead end', but going in that direction anyway will take you to the undercave underpass.
Going south will put you on the bending path, where you may find a hidden pebble. You can also reach the undercave underpass by going south again.
The undercave underpass converges to take you to the path slope.

If you'd like to know exactly where the hidden pebble is, ^[extinguish your torch and look for entrances on the right side of the area.]

# What do I do in the path slope area?
Things seem a bit... 'off' here. Why not have a look at your surroundings?

## What am I looking for?
The vertical wall - Zniw can 'look' at it to reveal more of the area.

# How do I move that stick?
See [this guide](boulder.md) for hints on moving the stick.

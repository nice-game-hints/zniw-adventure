The boulder has blundered - what's left of this cave?

# I've come to a crossroads.
The path on the right ^[is a slow march towards a collectible pebble - nothing more. You can move faster if you double-click on a spot you'd like to move to, though.]

# I have taken the left path
Ew, gross! What is that?

# I thought you'd know!
I do! It's a gross block of mixed dirt, rocks, and moss! Get rid of it?

# How do I get rid of it?
Surely you have something sharp enough to dig through moss and dirt?

# ... My big dinosaur hands?
Well, realistically, yes - but this dinosaur doesn't like getting her hands dirty like that.

# What do I need to use, then?
The item you need would make up one-half of a shovel.

## What do I have that's like that?
The single twig you got from your ladder gambit! 

Use it on the moss, and you'll slowly dig through it to exit the cave!

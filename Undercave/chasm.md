After lighting the torch, you likely read about a chasm that prevented the previous lost soul from escaping.

# Where is this chasm?
In the left side of the cave.

# Woah, there's boulders in the way!
If you need help with getting rid of them, [this guide](boulders.md) has the hints you need.

# Boulders-be-gone!
Hooray! Now you can access the cave and find the aforementioned chasm.

# How do I get over the chasm?
Jumping isn't an option here, and you already used the rope to make the ladder... hmm...

# Can I get a hint?
Is there anything in your inventory that can help you here?

# I don't think so!
Ladders aren't JUST for travelling vertically, you know.

## Tell me how to get across the chasm.
Use your ladder on the chasm when you're ready to cross it - but only when you're ready to leave.

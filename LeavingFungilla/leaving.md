Agu's plan is to re-open the village gate so that nobody will get hurt when you confront the Pterosaur - make your way there!

# What about all the villagers?
You can talk to them, of course! Just remember that you're supposed to make your way to the main gate.

# Can you direct me to the outskirts?
You've started in the West District, so head east twice - once takes you into the market, twice takes you to the outskirts.

# Where do I go from here?
East again to the mushroom path, and then east one more time to the mushroom crossing.

# Where is the village exit from here?
The symbols scrawled onto the wall may guide you.

# Tell me how to reach the village exit.
You've reached the mushroom crossing - use the northwestern exit.

# What do I do here?
You had a quick chat with a guarding Spinops - his responses:

"Why are you gathering here?" ^[Bigger dinosaurs couldn't fit in the UnderCave, and even if they could, the entrance is firmly sealed.]
"You seem rather stressed...?" ^[It's a hard life being a dinosaur - predators are scary!]

# What now?
Use the blue key on the right pillar, and the red key on the left pillar.

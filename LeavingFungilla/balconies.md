After ringing the gong, there's still a few balconies to traverse before you reach street level.

# Where do we go?
Besides stealing food, there's not much to do on the first balcony except climbing down.

# How do I get down?
The same way Zniw has always climbed down - the grappling hook!

## What do I attach the hook to?
On the east side of the area, you can attach the grappling hook to a pointy rock to climb down a level.

# Where do we go now?
Still not quite at ground level, but almost there!

# How do I get down?
The grating is a bit of a red herring - you're looking for another stalagmite.

## Where is the stalagmite?
On the left side of the area, this pointy rock is hidden amongst the green moss.

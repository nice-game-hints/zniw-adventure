You can now see clearly, thanks to the oil lamp - but trying to move up the stairs seems risky without checking out the rest of the tunnel first.

# What am I looking for?
Something that has been revealed in the background.

# Curse these limp arms!
As usual, ask Agu to do the heavy lifting after attempting it yourself.

# Praise these stubby legs!
As usual, your short stature comes to the rescue. Squeeze into the tunnel, and have a look around.

If you can't figure out where to go, click the question mark. ^[Move your mouse over the left side of the screen to move deeper into the tunnel.]

# Now what?
You need to find a way to get the Chief's wife and daughter down.

# How do I do that?
There are several stalagmites around this part of the cave.

## Tell me how to get the chief's wife and daughter down.
Use the grappling hook on a stalagmite to your left to get them down.

# Now what?
Get up the stairs for the final battle!

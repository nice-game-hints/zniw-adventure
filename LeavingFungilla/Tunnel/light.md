Just like the UnderCave, the first order of business is lighting up your surroundings somehow.

# Do I need another torch?
Not a torch - but something similar.

# What am I looking for?
An oil lamp.

# Where do I find it?
It's pretty unassuming-looking, but the game literally has two arrows pointing to it.

# Now what?
The tunnel is lit up - you can't take the lamp with you, but it has revealed [something suspicious](noise.md) in the background.

Your not-quite-hard-earned money has been stolen, and the only way in and out of the village has been destroyed. Could this day get any worse?

# What can I do to make it better?
There is one person who might know how to help - Tra, the Nothronychus that introduced you to the village.

# Where did she say she was going?
To the market, to get some food.

# Where is the market?
You shouldn't have much trouble finding it as you explore the village. It's huge, and you should really explore as much as you can!

## Where is Tra?
She's checking out the food stall that's being run by a friendly Thescelosaurus.

# I have talked to Tra.
Great - she mentioned possibly getting you a job if you came to talk to her on the farm.

# Where can I find the farm?
It'll be on the edge of town.

# Which edge?
Try heading west.

## I can't seem to find the farm!
Go west of the market into the west district, and then north into the fields.

To the far east of the fields, a small bridge over the stream will take you to the farm where you can talk to Tra again.

# What now?
Talk to her to find out more [about that job.](Money/mammals.md)

The trash is cleared, and you've reached what SHOULD be the hidden tunnel. Where is it?

# Hmm...
Maybe it's behind something? Have a look at everything here.

# If I were a criminal...
You would probably try to obscure the entrance somehow!

# But...
The dry bushes don't seem to hide the tunnel.

# If I was a Bond villain...
You would set up an elaborate and unassuming-looking puzzle using objects around the tunnel!

# What do I do with these trash bags?
You can pick them up with the fluffy glove.

# What now?
You can only pick up one trash bag at a time - they don't seem to be very special, so don't worry about checking underneath each one.

# What now?
Zniw mentioned the ground seeming suspicious, like it had been recently dug up - why not look at any suspicious spots?

# What am I looking for?
Circles on the ground. Each one has a slightly different, yet important, description.

# Look, look, look...
There must be something more to this puzzle. Maybe you can get underground through sheer force?

## How do I exert 'sheer force'?
Use something heavy on the suspicious freshly-dug spots.

# Where do I find something heavy?
Most things in this area seem pretty heavy!

## Which spot do I interact with?
The one in the northwest corner of the area, between the two trash bags.

# Hooray?

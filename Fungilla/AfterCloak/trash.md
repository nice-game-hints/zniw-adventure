So, we found the hidden path - and it was blocked by a mound of smelly trash.

# What will I need to clear the path?
A simple object won't do the job here - maybe someone can help?

# What kind of dinosaur would help me here?
Someone strong that isn't already busy.

# Where would I find someone like that?
In a place where there wasn't much going on earlier.

## Tell me where I can find someone who will help.
At the lake near the west district, you can find a Pentaceratops who clearly has time to help.

## What did he have to say?
"So, there's a lake even here..." ^[The water comes from Jaw Mountain's summit, totally clean!]
"What are you doing here?" ^[He's waiting for his buddy to strap the barrels onto his back, and has been delivering water like this for five years - he used to clear debris and trash from the paths.]

## What else did he have to say?
"Whose shack is it anyway?" ^[An elder turtle's, who usually spends his time fishing. If you want to talk to him, you should come back at night.]
(After telling him about the trash bags) ^[He comes with you to clear them.]

# Hooray!
The trash is clear, and you can access the [back alley!](alley.md)

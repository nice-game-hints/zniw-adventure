The Unescoceratops is bored out of his mind, but still dedicated to his job enough to stop you from taking the metal hook.

# What do I need to distract him with?
He mentioned a comic book - maybe you can find one in the village?

# Where should I begin looking for a comic book?
They don't seem to be for sale, so maybe you can find someone just reading a comic?

# Tell me where to begin looking.
You may have overlooked someone in the plaza.

## Where is the comic book reader?
On the northwestern side of the plaza, a Stegoceras is reading a comic book near the fountain.

## I have talked to the Stegoceras
Great, then Zniw's wonderful personality has made him throw the comic bok on the ground! Pick it up! 

# What do I do with the comic book?
Give it to the Unescoceratops in the pantry to distract him.

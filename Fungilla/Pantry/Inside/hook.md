You've had your fill of the food stocks in the pantry and now have your eyes on something shiny.

# Don't mind if I do!
Unfortunately, the hook can't just be taken - you'll need to distract the nearby Unescoceratops somehow.

# How do I do that?
Talk to him and see if you can figure out what will distract him.

## What did he have to say?
"Why are you here all alone?" ^[He's on guard duty, and dreadfully bored.]
"Can I get a food ration?" ^[Yes, just get on with it and leave him alone.]

## What else did he have to say?
"Tough times?" ^[There's no end to the guard duty in sight, even though the thief's been caught.]
"And that's all you do here?" ^[Yep - dreadfully boring, and his books are getting boring after re-reading them so often. He has resorted to reading Zauroforce comics.]

# What do I need to distract him with?
A comic book!

## Where do I find a comic book?
[This guide](comic.md) might help.

# I now have a comic book.
Give it to the Unescoceratops and you can finally take the hook!

It's well guarded, and you need a special pass to get in. Where would you find a special pantry pass?

# Under a rock?
No, it's too valuable to leave lying around like that.

You'll need to get it from someone in the village.

# Who would give me their pantry pass?
Someone who doesn't need it.

## Who doesn't need their pantry pass?
The Navajodactylus currently resting in the Healer's house clearly isn't getting around much.

# How do I get the pass from him?
Maybe if you (metaphorically) scratch his back, he'll (metaphorically) scratch yours? With a pantry pass?

You've searched high and low for the [mushrooms](Pharmacy/caps.md), bought a fancy glass (Pharmacy/container.md) and finally have the spicy mushroom sauce.

If the pharmacist didn't give you the option to make hot mushroom sauce, visit the guard in the area northeast of the plaza and look at his food bowl.

# How do I get this stuff into his food without him noticing?
His watchful eyes are mostly concerned with threats from the ground.

# How do I become a threat from above?
You will need something that lets you get up high.

# What kind of item would let me get up high?
It's a video game - how have you accessed hard-to-reach areas in games like Zelda?

## Tell me how to get up high.
You will need a grappling hook.

# How do I get a grappling hook?
You will need to make one with its base components; a hook and a rope.

# Where do I find a hook?
[This guide](Pantry/Inside/hook.md) may help you.

# Where do I find a rope?
You may have seen one earlier.

# I have seen many things ealier - when did I see a rope?
On your recent shopping trip.

## Tell me where to find the rope.
It can be bought from the used wares shop for 20 shells - or 10, if you have the discount pass.

# Now what?
You need to combine the hook and rope to make a grappling hook (though the game calls it a 'climbing hook'), and look for some way to get onto the upper sections of the village.

# Where can I get onto upper section?
You don't want to stray too far - Zniw isn't an Assassin's Creed protagonist, so the closer the helpful thing is to the guard, the better.

## Tell me how to get onto the upper section.
In the north-east corner of the plaza, very close to the exit into the area with the guard, you can use the grappling hook on a lone rock to access the upper area of the village.

# What now?
You're in a prime position for making some food inedible! Pour some sauce into the Triceratops' food bowl!

# I feel kinda guilty...
You should! But you have access to a [new area](/ResidentialWall/index.md) now, at least.

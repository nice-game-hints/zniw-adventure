In your gallavanting throughout the village and its open buildings, you likely met the Unescoceratops who was suffering from a cold.

# Colds are usually spread, right?
That's right - he probably got it from someone, so does anyone else in the village have a cold?

# Hmm...
It doesn't seem like it, right? So maybe they've recently recovered?

# What does someone who recently recovered from a cold look like?
Probably pretty happy with themselves!

## Tell me who I should speak to.
The joyous Albertonykus in the western district is worth speaking to.

## What now?
After [completing a job for Tra](afterwork.md), the healer is back. You should speak to her, if you haven't already.

# What can the healer do?
Her father was an alchemist - she probably knows all kinds of herbal remedies.

# What does she need to make a cure for the common cold?
Herbs!

# Where could I find herbs?
There are plenty of herbivores in the village - maybe herbs are being sold as food?

## Tell me where to find herbs.
They can be bought from the market, sold at the food stall you first found Tra.

Buying them will cost you 10 shells.

# I have the herbs!
They're not very useful on their own - go see if the healer can do anything with them.

# Hurrah!
Remember, she wants the bowl back - now go give the medicine to the Unescoceratops!

# Where is he again?
In the market, go up the stairs to the right of the Troodon and into the used wares shop.

# He's cured!
Fantastic! Now you can buy anything you want from his shop.

# What now?
Head outside and [enjoy the show!](AfterCloak/index.md)

If nothing happened when you went outside, you may wish to explore the village some more (especially around the plaza) and talk to everyone you see.

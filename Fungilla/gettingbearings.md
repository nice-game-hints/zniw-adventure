If you're really not sure where to even start when it comes to exploring the village, these hints are for you.

# Where should I start?
Why not try to find some villagers to talk to?

# Where might they hang out?
Well, shady spots are nice to hang out in. Head into the cool shade street on the east side of the plaza!

## Now what?
Aw, crap! All that money gone in an instant! Maybe that friendly dinosaur Tra could help you? If only you [knew where she was...](tra.md)

Generally speaking though, the village is now totally open for you to explore. Look around, talk to everyone you see, and get immersed in this adorable dinosaur settlement!

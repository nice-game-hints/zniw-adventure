We have the [three mushrooms](caps.md), and now just need a container to keep the sauce in.

# What kind of container do I need?
Hot mushroom sauce is probably too potent for a simple wooden bowl - we need something that won't melt.

# Tell me what kind of container I need.
You need something glass.

# Where do I find something glass?
Most of the local market stalls are focused on food or nik-naks - if you can't find it in the market, why not try the shops?

## Tell me exactly where to find the glass container.
You can find glass bottles for sale in the used wares shop.

# How much?
200 shells!

# WHAT?!
It's a bit steep - but you don't need to buy it right now! In fact, I recommend that you come back here after solving the mystery of the [thief's map.](/Fungilla/AfterCloak/index.md)

# I have the bottle!
Great! Now you just need to talk to the pharmacist again and tell her that you have everything.

This will reward you with the [spicy mushroom sauce.](/Fungilla/spicy.md)

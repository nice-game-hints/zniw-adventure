If you're eager for extra work (or more likely, extra cash) you can talk to Tra after speaking to her father for extra work.

# What's the new task?
You need to water the plants using a bucket, and remove any weeds by using a special glove.

# Is there anything else I need to know?
The bucket leaks, so you will need to complete the job quickly.

# How does this job work from a gameplay perspective?
You have two icons - 'water' and 'glove.' 

A panel shows several plants that you need to have the bucket selected to water, and watering them more than once drowns them and reduces your reward.
Weeds must be pulled up, and to do so you'll need to have the glove selected.

Time is up when the water has run out, and your reward is increased for every plant you water / weed you pull up.

# Can I water the plants again?
Yep! This job can be repeated as many times as you want - it's a great source of quick money!

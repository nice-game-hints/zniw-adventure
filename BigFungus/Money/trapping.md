Working a little harder for extra pay may well be worth your while.

## How much money do I get for each trapped mammal?

The money you get for not trapping any mammals - ^[50 shells]
The money you get for trapping one mammal - ^[80 shells]
The money you get for trapping two mammals - ^[110 shells]
The money you get for trapping all three mammals - ^[140 shells]

# Ooooh, money! Talk me through the trapping!
You need a few things for a successful trap:
1) Something to keep the mammal trapped
2) Something to prop up the trap
3) Something to yank away the prop
4) Something to attract the mammal

## Can you tell me exactly how trapping works?
1) Find a suspicious spot, and put the wooden box down on it
2) Find the stick on the left side of the area, and use it to prop up the box
3) Tie the thread to the stick
4) Place some bait under the trap ^[juniper berries OR breadfruit can be used here.]
5) Hide behind the tree!
6) Tell the Unescoceratops about the trapped mammal
7) Repeat the process two more times for the maximum payout! ^[You will need to replenish your bait at least once - there are plenty of berries and fruit in the boxes.]

# How do I return to Fungilla?
When you're ready to return, speak to the Unescoceratops and tell him that you are done for the day.

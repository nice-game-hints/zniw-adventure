Getting into the Residential Wall will require you to distract the guard; thankfully, we now know that the pharmacist can make a hot mushroom sauce that will do exactly that.

# What does the pharmacist need to make hot mushroom sauce?
Three types of mushrooms.
1) The blue azure cap.
2) The yellow sulforous cap.
3) The red vermillion cap.

She also warns that you should avoid grabbing them with your bare hands, and asks that you bring your own container.

# How do I avoid grabbing the mushrooms with my bare hand?
Do you know anyone who handles plants regularly?

# Not really.
They work with plants all the time, and probably have special equipment for dealing with problematic ones.

## Tell me who I'm looking for.
You need to speak to Tra, the Nothronychus on the farm. Agree to help her with the plants to get a fluffy glove.

# Now what?
We need to find the mushrooms.

# What was I told about the mushrooms again?
The red vermillion cap - ^[It's a common sight in the village and surrounding areas.]
The blue azure cap - ^[Usually grows on rough terrain, like rock formations.]
The yellow sulforous cap - ^[Grows in dark and damp places, like tunnels and caves.]

# Can I get a clue for the red cap?
You passed by it a few times earlier, but may not have had the item required to take it until now.

## Tell me where to find the red vermillion cap.
You previously saw it on the farm - it was right next to the bridge.

# Can I get a clue for the yellow sulforous cap?
You may have found it about an hour ago - it was in a place that the pharmacist mentioned.

If you forgot her clue - ^[This mushroom grows in dark and damp places, like tunnels and caves.]

# But this place is pretty big...
It wasn't too far into the cave - you will find it if you stick to the linear path.

## Tell me where to find the yellow sulforous cap.
It's in the exact spot where the boulder smashed through the wall. Use the fluffy glove to grab it.

Don't forget to ditch your torch after leaving the cave again, if you brought it with you.

# Can I get a clue for the blue azure cap?
It's growing in a wild area full of rocks, not far from the cave entrance.

# Tell me where to find the blue azure cap.
The blue azure mushroom is in an area to the left of the symbols that pointed out where the village was.

# How do I reach the mushroom?
In this instance, you should be trying to bring it down to you rather than reaching it.

# How do I do that?
Do you have anything that would be good at breaking rocks?

## Where do I find something good at breaking rocks?
The used wares shop in the village can sell you a pickaxe for 40 shells.

# I now have all three mushrooms.
Great, now we just need a container! See [this guide](container.md) for help with finding one.

Speaking to the healer revealed that the pharmacy can only be accessed with a special pass. Where might you find one?

# Under a rock?
A pass as special as this is unlikely to be left laying around.

# So where would I find one?
You'll likely get it from someone authorised to give you one.

# Who would be authorised?
Someone who is familiar with the pharmacist.

## Who do I get the special pass from?
The healer.

# How do I get it from her?
If these are special passes for special people, you'll have to prove that you're worthy of a pass.

# How do I do that?
[Helping others](cold.md) is a good place to start!

## I have helped someone thanks to that guide; what now?
Then you've got an empty bowl - wouldn't it be good manners to return it to its owner?

# It would indeed!
That's right - returning the bowl to the healer will get you the special pharmacy pass as a reward!

# But wait, where is the pharmacy?
On the other side of town - it's not very well advertised.

## Tell me where to find the pharmacy.
On the cool shade street, east side of town - the pharmacy is the only building on this street that has a dinosaur answer the door when you knock.

# How do I get in?
Well, you have a pass - just show it to the door!

After showing it off once, you can enter the pharmacy whenever you want - just be sure to knock.

## What does the pharmacist say?
"Is this pharmacy a family business?" ^[Yes - her family has operated the pharmacy for 40 years now, and she's been ready to inherit the business since she was young.]
"Is that your entire stock?" ^[It is an unusually small collection - the most expensive wares had to be hidden away to mitigate the risk of them being stolen.]

## What else did she have to say?
"Are you related to the healer Caenagnathus?" ^[No, they're from different clans and just good friends.]
"Can I buy a potion?" ^[Of course! Zniw asks about hot mushroom sauce here.]

# What does the pharmacist need to make hot mushroom sauce?
Three types of mushrooms.
1) The blue azure cap.
2) The yellow sulforous cap.
3) The red vermillion cap.

She also warns that you should avoid grabbing them with your bare hands, and asks that you bring your own container.

# Where do I find the mushrooms?
[This guide](caps.md) will point you in the direction of the mushrooms.

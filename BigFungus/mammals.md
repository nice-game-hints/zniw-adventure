Whew, what a large village! You finally managed to land a job, and Tra has sent you into the forest to deal with the mammals that have been ruining the village's food supplies.

# Deal with? Like... kill?
No, just to destroy their homes and put them in cages!

# Ah, much better! So, where do I start?
The friendly Unescoceratops said you could use anything in the area to deal with the problem - so why not grab everything you see?

# Generally speaking, what should I take away from here?
A square container, a fruit, a berry, a bit of rope, and a filled prized posession.

## Tell me exactly what I should be taking away from here.
1) A wooden box
2) A breadfruit from the box of breadfruit
3) A juniper berry from the box of berries
4) A thick thread from the sack next to the Unescoceratops
5) The Unescoceratops' waterskin (filled with water)

# Did the Unescoceratops say anything about the waterskin?
He asked you to get him some water from the nearby stream.

# Which way is the stream?
To the right - you passed it on your way down to the Unescoceratops.

## Does getting him the water do anything for me?
Well you'll feel better about yourself - and it teaches you that the waterskin can be filled with... water.

# Alright, what now?
Head to the left and try to devise a plan.

# What am I looking for?
Evidence of mammals in the area - anything that could point you in the direction of their nest.

Plus, additional items would be great - we have the backpack space to support them now!

# Can you tell me which items to look out for in this area?
You're looking for a stick, and can find some seeds - but they're stinky and not worth picking up.

# Can I go anywhere else from here?
There seems to be an opening on the far left...

# It's quite far up!
True - do you have anything that could boost Zniw's height?

## Tell me how to get up to the log.
Use the wooden box on the log to climb on top of it and get inside.

# A-ha!
We found the mammal nest! Now how do we destroy it?

# Big dinosaur feet!
That would be ideal, but Zniw just isn't that kind of girl. Maybe you can just put something into the holes?

## What should I put in the holes?
The water in your waterskin should flush them out!

# Nice! Now what?
Grab the unconscious mammal and show it to the Unescoceratops!

# Is there anything else to do here?
You could try to trap three extra mammals - this is optional, but will get you a pay bonus!

See [this guide](Money/trapping.md) for information on the pay bonus and steps you need to take to trap the mammals.

When you're ready to return to Fungilla, speak to the Unescoceratops and tell him that you are done for the day.

After a bit of exploring, you may have found some symbols telling you (roughly) where to go.

If you'd like to see them again, click the question mark. ^[![Symbols image](symbols.PNG)]

# Where should I begin looking for the village?
As the symbols showed, you should be looking to the south after heading west of the Undercave entrance.

# I've gone south - where to now?
This path is a bit awkward to navigate - keep trying to go west and you'll eventually make it to the village.

# What can I do in the village?
That's a question for [this guide!](/Fungilla/index.md)

Speaking to the healer revealed that the pharmacy can only be accessed with a special pass. Where might you find one?

# Under a rock?
A pass as special as this is unlikely to be left laying around.

# So where would I find one?
You'll likely get it from someone authorised to give you one.

# Who would be authorised?
Someone who is familiar with the pharmacist.

## Who do I get the special pass from?
The healer.

# How do I get it from her?
If these are special passes for special people, you'll have to prove that you're worthy of a pass.

# How do I do that?
[Helping others](cold.md) is a good place to start!

## I have helped someone thanks to that guide; what now?
Then you've got an empty bowl - wouldn't it be good manners to return it to its owner?

# It would indeed!
That's right - returning the bowl to the healer will get you the special pharmacy pass as a reward!
